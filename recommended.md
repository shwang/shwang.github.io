## The Meritocracy Trap by Daniel Markovits

Why are those elitist coastal urbanites so deadset on sending their kids to Ivy League universities? Why is the American heartland rusting and the middle class shrinking?
Why have all the good jobs gone to the big cities? Why do our most successful and powerful have a distain for the salt-of-the-earth American?

The conventional narrative tells us that the fact that rich people tend to have more educated kids is a sign that we don't have a true meritocracy.
Because if it were a true meritocracy, wouldn't rich and poor folks have equal chance at good educations?

Daniel Markovits argues that all of these problems are at least related to natural consequences of meritocracy.

You can learn about Markovits's provocative alternative narrative in [this Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/meritocracys-miserable-winners/594760/).


## Tribe by Sebastian Junger

In our ancestral environment, we lived in constant danger and fought to protect and care for a small band of kin.

Is this related to why veterans look back so fondly on some aspects of war, Britain saw psychiatric disorder counts collapse during the Great Blitz,
and some European settlers ran away to join American Indian tribes (but never vice versa, as the book claims)?

What can the relationship between our psychology and the ancestral environment tell us about living a good life in the modern world?


## One Billion Americans by Matt Ynglesias

Super provocative and controversial: An argument that having 1 billion Americans by 2100, through a combination of increased birth rate and immigration, is good for both the USA and the world.
